The House Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the prices of houses based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, year built, and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide accurate price estimations that can assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions. The project involves data collection, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. Various algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, will be explored to find the most effective model. The final system will allow users to input key attributes of a house and receive an estimated market value.
